<h3>How To Play</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Everyone creates a dare and gives it a "drink" rating</li>
    <li>When it's your turn, touch on the paper to reveal your dare and read it to your friends</li>
    <li>Perform the dare, or use your one free pass for the entire game</li>
    <li>
        When it <bold>is not</bold> your turn, you get to vote on how well your friend performed the dare
        <br>
        You can vote:
        <ol>
            <li>Did Bad = Friend drinks</li>
            <li>Free Pass = Friend passes without drinking</li>
            <li>Did Good = Friend gives out drinks</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
